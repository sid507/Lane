<h2>Traffic Density Using OpenCV</h2>

<h3>Density greater than 0.9</h3>
The time of green signal is given large as compared to below two,So that the vehicle can pass easily

<h3>Density greater than 0.5 and less than 0.9</h3>
The time of green signal is less than above but greater than below

<h3>Density less than 0.5</h3>
The time of green signal is very less and the density is very low which tells the road is not conjusted
